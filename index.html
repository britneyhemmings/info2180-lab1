    <h2>Britney Hemmings</h2>
    <p>I'm an aspiring Software Engineer and a "WebDev Superstar". I currently major in Computer Science and minor in Economics at the University of the West Indies. I was born and spent majority of my childhood in the city of Kingston located on the beautiful Caribbean island, Jamaica. After completing my Bsc degree, I intend to further my studies in Computer Science or another tech-related field. Two of my life goals are to own a software company or develop a successful application software and travel the world. I enjoy watching TV series and reading novels. My favourite TV series is Grey's Anatomy and my favourite books are Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen and To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee.</p>
